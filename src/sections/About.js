            <h3>To provide you with a personality.</h3>
            <br/>

            <h3>About</h3>

            <p>There are many reasons you might need a new personality.  You need a 'customer persona' to represent your business' ideal customer and don't know where to start.  Pardue, your Holy Man, has gone mad and you need a new character.  Or... you just don't have a personality.  Fear not... that is why we created Personary.</p>

            <p>Similar to the way writers experience writer's block, you are probably wondering how you even start creating a 'person'.  We have made that simple by providing you with some tools you can use to write your new character's description and history.  While we have left certain details, such as occupation, gender and ethnicity out, let the suggested name or background, or still better yet, your need, make that decision.  Let our random character's age, eye color, hair and body descriptor give you the building blocks of a description.  Let the relationship status and number of children as well as the personality type give you the clues that will help you fill in the your character's history.</p>

            <p>All you have to do is imagine why the thirty-something honey blonde with long flowing hair, steel gray eyes, no children and an INTJ personality type plays the ondes Martenot in the local philharomic orchestra.  You can write as little as you want or up to five pages; allowing a fair depth of character to be created.</p>
